# Tropical Cyclone Intensity Probabilistic Prediction -Pytorch


This is the official source code of the paper PTCIF: Probabilistic Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting Based on Deep Learning.

Deep learning based TC intensity prediction has been shown to outperform traditional methods. Nonetheless, there are inherent uncertainties in weather forecasting due to the complexity, nonlinearity, and chaotic effects of the Earth system. This study proposes a deep learning framework, PTCIF, to quantify this uncertainty from multimodal meteorological data, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first study to assess TC uncertainty based on a deep learning approach.


Our code will be coming soonÔºÅ
